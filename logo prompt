Create a BLACK LINE ILLUSTRATION logo featuring a contained interior space 
with everyday objects arranged in a distorted, claustrophobic composition.

CONCEPT:
Inside a SQUARE FRAME, a surreal domestic scene with familiar objects 
positioned and warped as if viewed through an unsettling perspective.
The objects are recognizable but feel DISPLACED, COMPRESSED, MERGED.
This suggests: creativity emerges from everyday moments, collaboration 
transforms the mundane into something profound.

OVERALL AESTHETIC:
- Francis Bacon's spatial distortion (warped perspective, compressed depth)
- BUT rendered in PURE LINE WORK (no shading, no hatching, no gray)
- Outline-based with occasional SOLID BLACK areas for contrast
- Clean, readable, not photorealistic
- Looks hand-drawn but controlled and intentional

THE SQUARE FRAME:
- Clear bordered rectangle (the containing space)
- Inside: objects and space feel WRONG in a beautiful way
- Perspective lines converge unnaturally
- Objects feel STACKED, TILTED, OVERLAPPING in impossible ways
- Creates tension between familiar objects and alien composition

THE FIVE OBJECTS (choose 2-3, arranged densely):

1. **VASE + FLOWER**
   - Vase tilted or twisted at unnatural angle
   - Flower emerging but petals warped/exaggerated
   - Vase could be compressed or elongated
   - Occupies one corner of the frame

2. **TALL CANDLE**
   - Standing but LEANING or BENDING unnaturally
   - Flame distorted (could be stretched, warped, or melting)
   - Creates vertical tension in composition
   - Thin confident line

3. **AMORPHOUS SCULPTURE**
   - Organic, blob-like form
   - Could be sitting, floating, or embedded in space
   - Adds weightless, dreamlike element
   - Pure outline, no internal detail

4. **FRAMED PICTURE ON WALL**
   - Simple rectangular frame
   - But tilted, floating, or nested inside other objects
   - Creates layered depth (art within art within logo)
   - Inside frame: simple line drawing (abstract or minimal)

5. **BICYCLE**
   - Partial or full bicycle
   - One wheel tilted, frame bent, chain visible but distorted
   - Could be leaning against or INTO other objects
   - Creates mechanical contrast against organic forms

COMPOSITION LOGIC:
- Objects OVERLAP and INTERPENETRATE
- Some objects MERGE into the background or walls
- Perspective lines DON'T follow reality (Bacon's influence)
- Depth is AMBIGUOUS (can't tell what's front/back)
- Everything fits within the square, but feels CROWDED yet BALANCED
- No empty space (maximal occupation of frame)

LINE QUALITY:
- Consistent, confident line weight (NOT varied thick/thin)
- Pure BLACK lines on white
- NO shading, NO hatching, NO gradients
- Where needed: SOLID BLACK AREAS (not for shadow, but for graphic contrast)
- Line could define interior object edges OR be partially negative space
- Objects somewhat transparent to each other (lines show through)

SPATIAL DISTORTION (Bacon DNA):
- Vertical lines TILT or CURVE slightly
- Horizontal lines SLOPE unnaturally
- Objects appear COMPRESSED vertically or horizontally
- Depth recedes in IMPOSSIBLE ways
- Viewer feels mildly UNSETTLED but INTRIGUED
- Space feels CLAUSTROPHOBIC but RICH

NEGATIVE SPACE:
- Background is PURE WHITE (no filling)
- Objects defined entirely by BLACK LINES
- Some interior spaces of objects are SOLID BLACK (creates contrast)
- Some interior spaces are WHITE (outline only)
- Creates visual rhythm: line → white → line → black → line

VIBE:
- Surreal but GROUNDED
- Everyday but TRANSFORMED
- Chaotic but INTENTIONAL and READABLE
- Slightly unsettling in an artistic way
- Suggests: creativity happens when perspectives shift
- Two-becoming-one happens in the COMPRESSION of space
- Collaboration = objects that shouldn't coexist, coexisting

MOOD CONVEYANCE:
- "Ordinary becomes extraordinary through perspective"
- "Multiple elements, one coherent vision"
- "Playful spatial impossibility"
- "Contemporary art meets design"

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- Think: Single continuous line drawing where possible (but objects are separate)
- Objects defined by OUTLINE only
- Interior details minimal (just enough to be recognizable)
- Some objects PARTIALLY HIDDEN behind others
- Some objects PARTIALLY MERGED with frame edges

COLOR & FORMAT:
- Pure black on white
- No gradients, no color, no texture fills
- Works at any size
- Timeless aesthetic

DO NOT:
- ❌ No photorealistic shading or hatching
- ❌ No gray tones
- ❌ No realistic perspective (distort it)
- ❌ No floral or nature-heavy illustration (just objects)
- ❌ No cuteness or softness (keep it sophisticated)
- ❌ No text
- ❌ No obvious "two things merging" visual (let it be subtle)
- ❌ No heavy outlines (should feel light and confident)

REFERENCE AESTHETICS:
- Francis Bacon: spatial compression, claustrophobia, everyday objects warped
- Contemporary illustration: clean line work, minimalist fills
- Surrealist interior design: impossible spaces, coexisting realities
- Premium brand marks: sophisticated, memorable, timeless

FINAL RESULT:
A square frame containing 2-3 everyday objects (vase, candle, sculpture, frame, bicycle)
arranged in DISTORTED, WARPED, BACON-LIKE perspective.
Pure black line work. No shading. Solid black accents for contrast.
Looks like a contemporary art drawing that works perfectly as a logo.
Reads as: "Creativity transforms the everyday. Multiple perspectives create one vision."
